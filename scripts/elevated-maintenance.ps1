.SYNOPSIS
  Fixed maintenance operations that need elevation, runnable from an
            Desc = 'Restart the VS Code tunnel service once uptime exceeds 24h. Hygiene only: normalised by time spent, the failure rate does NOT rise with uptime (0.42/h at 0-4h vs 0.00/h at 4-8h). Threshold-guarded, so a run on a fresh tunnel is a no-op.'
            Daily = '05:00'
.DESCRIPTION
  The problem: several recurring operations need administrator rights —
  restarting the tunnel service (its task runs S4U, so unelevated
  Stop-Process silently fails), killing a runaway renderer, managing the
  Hyper-V VM. Each one costs a UAC prompt, and prompts get refused or missed
  when an agent triggers them.

  The solution: register this as a scheduled task running as SYSTEM with
  RunLevel Highest. A registered task can be triggered from ANY unelevated
  session with `schtasks /run` and no prompt. That is the same mechanism the
  tunnel service itself already uses.

  DELIBERATELY NOT a generic "run this command elevated" gate. Such a task is
  a privilege-escalation backdoor: any unelevated process on the machine could
  invoke it with arbitrary arguments. Instead every operation is a named
  branch below with FIXED behaviour, registered as its own task, so triggering
  it can only do the one reviewed thing.

  Adding an operation means editing this file and registering a new task —
  which is the point.

.PARAMETER Operation
  Which fixed operation to run. See the switch below.

.NOTES
  Register with -Register (needs one elevation, once).
  Then: schtasks /run /tn "CodaiMaint-TunnelRefresh"   (no prompt, forever)
